                        <p>An old, thrifted chair reinvented into a cozy, lounge chair for any home. This Chair Sculpture stands to express the emotion of bright, child-like happiness. It was created by fully disassembling the parts of an old chair, cutting and fastening them together in a shape similar to a rocking chair, and painting the wood a neutral white to let the teal upholstery pop. Broken CDs serve as the detailing on the arm rests to add some shine.</p>
