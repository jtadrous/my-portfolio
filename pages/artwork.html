              <em><h5>Wood Shop Project, 2020</h5></em>
              <p>
                An old, thrifted chair reinvented into a cozy, lounge chair for
                any home. This Chair Sculpture stands to express the emotion of
                bright, child-like happiness. It was created by fully
                disassembling the parts of an old chair, cutting and fastening
                them together in a shape similar to a rocking chair, and
                painting the wood a neutral white to let the teal upholstery
                pop. Broken CDs serve as the detailing on the arm rests to add
                some shine.

                A series of artwork created during the Beginning Drawing I and
                Beginning Painting I courses offered at the Herron School of
                Art. Most paintings were created using oil-based paints and fine
                brushes. All drawings were created using charcoal sticks and
                pencils.

              <p>
                A creative take on the Disney movie known as Maleficent. For
                this project, we were tasked with researching two different
                movie genres. We had to chose a movie from one of the genres and
                design a movie poster that would fit the second genre. Here I
                took the fantasy movie Maleficent and transformed it into the
                gangster genre. This was all designed in Adobe Photoshop.

                action movie of three sisters moving to the streets of Egypt for
                the summer to find happiness and passion. Each movie poster was
                made with a different aspect of the movie in mind and each has
                its own voice.

                A unique logotype of a chosen word crafted using typography

                style, texture, weight, emotional tone, etc.
